# Face Recognition Attendance System

> Automated attendance using face detection & recognition (Python, OpenCV, ML).

![Social preview or architecture diagram goes here](./media/cover.png)

## Overview
This project automates attendance by detecting and recognizing faces in real time, reducing manual errors and improving accuracy.

## Key Features
- Real-time face detection & recognition  
- Automatic attendance logging  
- Data preprocessing pipeline for consistent accuracy  
- (Planned) Admin dashboard, CSV/SQLite export

## Tech Stack
Python • OpenCV • scikit-learn / face_recognition • NumPy

## How It Works (Architecture)
1. Camera stream → 2. Face detection (Haar/HOG/CNN) → 3. Face embedding  
4. Classifier match → 5. Attendance log (CSV/DB)

## Datasets
- Use your own face images or publicly available datasets (respect licenses).

## Results
- Accuracy improved vs. manual entry in test runs (explain your metric briefly).

## Demo
- Add screenshots to `/media` and a short GIF of the pipeline.

## Setup (Future Code Placeholder)
```bash
# Example placeholder; replace later when you add code
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
